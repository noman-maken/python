If an employee approaches you and asks to leave the group for another group graciously allow them to do so. This doesn’t mean you have to let them leave in the middle of crunch time but as a general rule if they want to leave the group something isn’t working out for them and you should let them transfer even if they haven’t been in the group very long — say, less than one year.
Forcing employees to remain in your group can never lead anywhere good. It’ll impact their morale which impacts the morale of the entire group. It’s also likely they’ll become less effective and in extreme circumstances simply leave the company. Any manager that doesn’t allow their employees to leave has completely misunderstood how to produce the best possible balance of happiness and productivity in their employees and is a rookie mistake I’ve seen even experienced managers make far too often.
